## COVID-19 Data Analysing
This project displays and analyzes COVID-19 data, including confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, using charts that visualize the progress of the pandemic in different countries.

## How does it work?
- COVID-19 Data: The project uses CSV files containing daily COVID-19 data.
- Data Analysis: The CSV files are read using Pandas.
- Visualization: It generates interactive charts using Matplotlib that display daily and cumulative figures for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- Ease of Use: The user enters a country, and the system displays the corresponding data and charts for that country.
